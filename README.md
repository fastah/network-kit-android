# What can I do with this? 
These examples here help use the network more intelligently for the benefit of your users. This matters a lot if people aren't always on fast or cheap networks. 

# Examples
* Fetch audio, video or ads pre-emptively when network quality and cost are favourable; thereby allowing effectively offline audio, video or ad displays.

# This depends on Fastah Network Kit - Core
